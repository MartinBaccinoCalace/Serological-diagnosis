# Serological diagnosis with machine learning

Machine Learning Pipeline for Analyzing Serological Test Images
This project implements machine learning models to automatically analyze images from serological tests used in diagnostic procedures for blood transfusions. The pipeline efficiently scores diagnostic tests with accuracy comparable to existing costly methods, optimizing the diagnostic process while reducing expenses. Provides diagnostic accuracy comparable to traditional, more expensive methods, offering a scalable, low-cost alternative for healthcare providers. Reduces manual effort in test evaluation, minimizing human error.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
scikit-learn
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualizations, if needed)
Jupyter (optional, for running notebooks)
